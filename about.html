                <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Dr. Zaccary Pincock is an honors graduate of Pacific University College of Optometry.
                    Throughout his schooling, Dr. Pincock worked at a clinic in Hillsboro, Oregon specializing in
                    neurooptometric exams and testing. He is fluent in Spanish and also worked as an interpreter and a
                    teacher’s assistant in the Spanish for Optometry class teaching others to provide this service to
                    Spanish-speaking individuals. He enjoyed leading a team of fellow students on a volunteer mission
                    trip to perform eye exams on hundreds of natives in Costa Rica who had previously been unable to
                    obtain proper eye care.<br><br>
                    During his clinical rotations, Dr. Pincock gained experience in a wide variety of practice modes. At
                    the Community Health Center in Nipomo, California he performed examinations on the underserved
                    population of California, focusing on primary care with an emphasis on ocular disease. He then
                    worked at the Indian Health Services in Fort Hall, Idaho where he specialized in serving those with
                    ocular diseases such as glaucoma and systemic illnesses like diabetes. Dr. Pincock completed an
                    externship focused on pediatric vision therapy and sports vision where he specialized in treating
                    children as young as three months old with large refractive errors and those with strabismus and
                    amblyopia to realign their vision. He also helped patients born with optic nerve hypoplasia, fitting
                    them for specialty glasses so they could drive and work in the community, as well as patients
                    suffering from post-concussive syndrome from traumatic brain injury. Finally, Dr. Pincock finished
                    his clinical rotations at the Veteran’s Affairs hospital in Spokane, Washington where he diagnosed
                    and treated eye conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, cancer of
                    the eye, and cataracts.<br><br>
                    Dr. Pincock began his optometric career in a rural community in Eastern New Mexico. He enjoyed the
                    challenge of having to treat a variety of eye conditions and diseases. He was also able to refine
                    his skills with specialty contact lenses. From his experience, he has developed a passion for
                    helping others achieve their best possible vision with the aid of specialty contact lenses.<br><br>
                    Dr. Pincock grew up in the small farming town of Blackfoot, Idaho. He and his wife have three
                    energetic children—twin daughters and a son. In his free time, he enjoys playing the guitar,
                    singing, football, movies, traveling, paddleboarding, and being outdoors. Dr. Pincock looks forward
                    to serving you and your family.

                    With profound sadness, we announce the passing of Jeanette Pham, a devoted wife, loving mother, and
                    esteemed optometrist, who left this world at the age of 49.<br><br>
                    Beyond her role as a wife and mother, Jeanette was a highly respected optometrist, whose passion for
                    her work was evident in the care she provided to her patients. Her kindness and expertise touched
                    the lives of so many, and she found deep fulfillment in helping others see the world more
                    clearly—both literally and figuratively.
